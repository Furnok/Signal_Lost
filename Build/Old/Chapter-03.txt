Chapter-03(The Zoo)/50\<1>
[Scene 1 \\__
I guess I can go to the zoo, yeah.+__
I don't see how going in any of these locations could help me escape this island+__
So whatever you'll choose might be the best.+__

<(2)1 - Okay, go when you're ready!__
]

[Scene 2 __
It might take a few minutes before I get to the entrance of the zoo, so let's small talk a bit while we're here!+__
...+__
...+Uhm...+ Yeah...+ I'm kinda sorry for the position I put you in with this call and everything+__
but it seems-+ ...I didn't have that many choices.+__

<(3)1@ - No worries. I feel better knowing you're safe.__
<(5)2| - Your story still feels kinda weird to me...__
<(6)3 - It's true that I didn't expect to have this kind of call today!__
]

[Scene 3 __
T-Thanks...+__
It's good to know I can rely on you,+ especially in the kind of situation I'm in. So th-+ Thanks, I guess...+__

<(4)1 - Talking about that, this whole situation is trully unreal.__
]

[Scene 4 __
...+You're right...+__
...+It's pure madness.+ The more I think about it,+ the more fucked up it gets.+__
Why is this happening to me?+ Why did it call you?+ Why is everything set up as if it was on purpose?+__
Where the fuck am I?...+ WHY IS NO ONE HERE TO ANSWER MY DAMN QUESTIONS?!+__
*echoes fade in the distance*+__

<(7)1@ - Calm down, you'll be safe with me, I promise.__
<(11)2@ - All that matters is getting you out of here.__
<(9)3| - Keep quiet! Someone might hear you!__
]

[Scene 5 __
Are you still not believing m-...+__
UGH!+ You know what?+ It doesn't matter if you're not believing any of this.+__
I just want you to stay with me since this place is filled with puzzles I could not solve alone.+__
Sounds okay with you?+__

<(4)1 - Don't worry, I believe your story, it just feels... unreal.__
<(10)2@ - I guess I'll be your talkable web browser from now on!__
]

[Scene 6 __
Yeah, I guess so!+__
Neither I expected to wake up on a deserted island!+__
I'm currently living a movie plot...+ Cameras anywhere?+__
...+__
I can't even tell if I'm dreaming or not.+__

<(8)1@ - I can assure you I'm real, if that's a relief for you.__
<(4)2 - It's true, all of this is so unreal...__
]

[Scene 7 __
...Y-+You promise?...+__
Thanks...+__
Sorry, this whole situation has my mind doing backflips.+__
I just have to take a deep breath and it will be okay...+__
*breath*...+__
Alright!+ I'm up to go!+ I think I can keep going thanks to you.+__

<(15)1 - Nice! So, you're near the zoo now?__
]

[Scene 8 __
Well...+ On one hand, it's nice to know that I'm not talking to a ghost.+__
On the other hand, the fact that I'm not dreaming about being stuck in an abandonned city in the middle of the sea__
scares the shit out of me.+__
I'll eventually work out why all of this is happening in the first place,+__
but for now, let's just move forward.+__

<(15)1 - So, you're near the zoo now?__
]

[Scene 9 __
I'LL SCREAM AS LOUD AS I WANT!!+__
FUCK WHOEVER MADE ME GO HERE!+__
FUCK ME FOR NOT REMEMBERING WHO I AM!+__
FUCK THIS PHONE FOR HAVING YOU FOR ONLY CONTACT!+ TAKE THAT!+ *impact noises*+__
...+Oh no, no, no, no, what have I done...+ Please tell me you're still working...+__
...H-+Hello...+ You still hear me?...+__

<(12)1| - Yes, try not to break your only connection to the outside world next time.__
<(13)2@ - It's okay. Try to keep your mind straight, now's not the time to act recklessly.__
<(14)3| - I'm trying to help you and this is what I get? I'll hang up if you continue like that.__
]

[Scene 10 __
Good one, clown.+__
Anyway, I'm getting near the entrance of the zoo.+__
It might be better if we focus on getting out of here more than joking around.+__

<(15)1 - Let's explore the zoo since you're near it now, right?__
]

[Scene 11 __
That's right...+ Getting out of here...+__
...+If that's even possible.+ I mean...+__
Opening this trapdoor might be the only way out of here, but why is it here in the first place?+__
I guess I won't have any answer if I don't go and see by myself.+__

<(15)1 - The zoo could give you the keys for getting out of here. You're approaching it right?__
]

[Scene 12 __
I'm so, so, so sorry.+ I didn't mean to yell like that...+__
What is this thing made of?.+__
I don't know how much this piece of junk can endure but I don't want to find out.+__

<(15)1 - It's pretty solid for sure. But how about the zoo?__
]

[Scene 13 __
R-Right,+ you're right.+__
I'm lucky this flip phone can handle this much.+__
I think I can keep going now.+__

<(15)1 - That's okay. You arrived now?__
]

[Scene 14 __
NO PLEASE, I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD EVEN MAKE IT OUT ALIVE WITHOUT YOU!+__
O-Okay,+ I'll be more careful from now on...+ Please don't go.+__

<(15)1 - That's better. Now tell me, you're at the zoo?__
]

[Scene 15 __
Yes, There's a huge opened metallic gate right here. And also I'm in front of a map of the zoo...+__
...+__
...+It's almost unreadable.+ All of it's teared away and I can't even make up where to go.+__
Hahaha! Funny thing, it's shaped like Australia!+__
...+Is my brain fucked up for laughing at this?+__
I guess it is.+__

<(16)1 - Is there something else around?__
]

[Scene 16 __
Nothing that strikes my mi-+Oh wait!+__
There are flyers lying here and there.+ Let me try to catch one+__
...*footsteps*+...Oof!+__
...+I got one! *paper noises*+__
...Uhmm+...+It looks like a presentation of the animals of the zoo.+__
It's weird but there are words written using markers on the snake's page.+__

<(17)1 - What do they say?__
]

[Scene 17 __
There's the first word "BRSBNE",+__
then there's an arrow leading to the word "DRWN"+__
and the word "PRTH" at the very end.+__
Too bad I can't speak moon runes+__
#%aUsTraLiA+ miGhT hAvE+ SoMeThiNg tO+ dO WiTh+ This=#+__

<(21)1 - Let's why this page deserves to be writing on in this snake's vivarium!__
<(18)2 - What do you mean Australia?__
]

[Scene 18 __
Huh?+ I said nothing about Australia.+__
#%tHoSe WorDs+ CoULd bE+ ReLaTeD tO AusTrALiA's+ mAP, dOn'T+ yOu ThinK?=#__

<(19)1 - Why are you pretending it's not you saying those things?__
]

[Scene 19 __
Wh-whuh?+ I thought I was the one losing my mind but you seem pretty touched too.+__
I'm the only one talking to you right now, so let's focus on what's important :+__
Getting me OUT OF HERE!+__
#%i'LL bE+ hErE tO+ hELp yOu, tHe OtHeR OnE iS FoLLOwIng YoU=#+__

<(20)1| - Something weird is definitly going on...__
<(17)2 - Okay... What were those words again?__
]

[Scene 20 __
No shit Sherlock!+ Everything's weird in here.+__
I need your help now, so prove me you're not crazy and you can be helpful!+__

<(17)1 - Right... So, what were those words again?__
]

[Scene 21 __
Seeing what's inside this vivarium might be the best lead we have, you're right.+__
Even if these words marked very clearly on this flyers are extremly suspiscious, I guess we have no choice.+__
So? Where should I be heading now?+__

<(24)1 - Go North__
<(24)2 - Go South__
<(22)3 - Go East__
<(24)4 - Go West__
]

[Scene 22 __
Firstly East? That seems like a random choice but okay.+__
It's so weird walking near these empty enclosures.+__
Like, I feel that I'm the one being observed like an animal even if I'm the one outside of these cages.+__
Enough weird and paranoïd thoughts.+ What then?+__

<(23)1 - Go North__
<(24)2 - Go South__
<(24)3 - Go East__
<(24)4 - Go West__
]

[Scene 23 __
North second?+ I guess that'll do.+__
You're lucky that I can tell directions thanks to the position of the sun, or it would have been really awkward+__
Now that I think about it, I could triangulate my position thanks to the stars!+__
Too bad it's day time...+ And that I haven't got a fucking idea how star triangulation works in the first place+__
Anyway, where should I go next?+__

<(24)1 - Go North__
<(24)2 - Go South__
<(24)3 - Go East__
<(25)4 - Go West__
]

[Scene 24 __
Riiiight...+ You seem confident about it so I'm going to listen to you...+ *footsteps*+__
...+__
{SEVERAL MINUTES LATER}+__
...+__
...Well shit.+ I'm somehow back at the entrance.+ Nice direction you gave me there...+__

<(17)1 - I made a mistake. Could you give me those words that were on the flyer?__
]

[Scene 25 __
West?+ It's not like I know where to go anyway.+ I'll be with these snakes in a minute if you're right.+__
...*footsteps*+__
{SEVERAL MINUTES LATER}+ ...+Here I am! The vivarium...+is empty...+__
Well, that's anti-climatic!+ I expected to be bit by a viper or something.+__
#%I hOpE yOu'LL rEmeMbEr ThE wAy bAcK=#+__

<(26)1 - What do you see around you?__
]

[Scene 26 __
I see an emergency exit right at the bottom.+__
There's also an opened glass cage, it looks like the main attraction of this place.+__
There are severals palm trees here and there and a reception desk over here.+__
What should I do?+__

<(27)1 - The exit door could be your way out!__
<(32)2 - Let's look at this glass enclosure__
<(28)3 - Is there something interesting with these palm trees?__
<(29)4 - Search for clues inside the reception desk.__
]

[Scene 27 __
I hope this emergency exit does what it 's supposed to do.+__
*footsteps*+......+You're kidding me...+__
What kind of shit-brained buffoon puts a freaking renforced chain on an emergency exit??+__
...+hope there is something to break it down near there.+__

<(26)1 - What can you see again?__
]

[Scene 28 __
What interesting would there be about a plain, normal palm tr-...+__
...+Nevermind.+ There are creepy insciptions all over this one.+__
"GET ME OUT, HE'S OBSERVING ME, I CAN FEEL HIM PLAYING WITH MY MIND..."+__
...+Nope, nope nope nope,+ that's it.+ I don't want to read more of it.+__

<(30)1| - Come on, keep reading!__
<(26)2 - Let's ignore this for now. Is there something else around you?__
]

[Scene 29 __
Let's see what's in here.+__
*rummage noises*+...+It's a mayhem!+ There are flyers scattered all over the floor.+__
*cough, cough*+ God!+ The air is so dirty in here!+__
I didn't even move these papers that much,+ why is there so much dust flying around?+__
*cough*+ It's wei-*cough*+__

<(26)1 - Leave somewhere else before you asphyxiate yourself__
]

[Scene 30 __
Your curiosity is going to drive me insane, you know that?+__
...+"I WILL KILL THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.+ I WILL BE MYSELF AGAIN.+ IT WILL LEAVE ME ALONE"+__
...+Seriously....+I-I'm trembling in fear right now...+__
L-Let's tell that this thing never existed+__

<(31)1| - You're kidding me? This must mean something!__
<(26)2 - Okay, let's look what else is here.__
]

[Scene 31 __
AND I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT!+__
I'm already on the edge of vomitting of fear, so please let's wrap it up and get out of here quickly.+__
I feel unsafe...+__
And watched...+__

<(32)1 - Okay... Is there something else here?__
]

[Scene 32 __
I'm near the enclosure. It's really big!+ Looks like it's trying to remake a wild environment+__
There's a sign near the door with "WATCH OUT, VENIMOUS TIGER-SNAKES INSIDE" marked on it.+__
Normally I would freak out at this point but I know there's no living think anywhere here!+__

<(33)1 - Is there more precisions on the sign?__
<(34)2 - Go see what's inside.__
<(26)3 - Seems dangerous... Let's see if there's more thing around before.__
]

[Scene 33 __
Uh... If you want a lesson about tiger-snake I can tell you what's on it I guess.+__
"Tiger snake, or genus Notechis, are Australian member of the cobra family, or Elapidae.+__
The snake’s venom, which contains a blood-clotting agent as well as a nerve paralyzer, is potentially fatal to humans.+__
immediate injection of anti-venom is the only way to make it out without irreversible damage"+__

<(34)1 - Now that you're educated, you can go inside!__
]

[Scene 34 __
It's weird to put a foot inside an animal enclosure.+__
Feels like I'm the one being wa-*THUMB*+__
...+Oh no...+__

<(35)1 - What was that sound?__
]

[Scene 35 __
T-The door of the cage...+__
It...+__
IT CLOSED BEHIND ME!+ I'M STUCK IN THE CAGE!+__
WHO DID THA-...+__
Ouch?+__

<(36)1 - What was that?__
]

[Scene 36 __
I...+ I just got stung by somthing behind my neck...+__
What is it...+ Uh?+ It says "snake veno-...+__
OH MY GOD, IT'S A POISONNED DART!!+__
Oh shit, shit shit shit!+ I'm going to DIE POISONNED!!+__

<(37)1 - Keep calm. It must be another puzzle!__
]

[Scene 37 __
Y-You're right!+ These plastic bottles might have something to do with it and-+__
Oh lord, it looks like vials with syringes of medication...+ Don't tell me I have to inject one of these things...+__
Shit...+ I can feel my consciouscness flying away...+__

<(38)1 - Quick, tell me what are these bottles!__
]

[Scene 38 __
"O...+One has a label with "mRNA-1273"...+__
The...+other one is "ASVS serum"...+__
The last one has...+ "liquified HCN"+__
Please hurry...+ I don't want to die here...+__

<^(39)1 - Take the mRNA-1273__
<(41)2 - Take the ASVS serum__
<(39)3 - Take the liquified HCN__

[Scene 39 \__
...+Okay...+ huff+__
I'm shooting it in my arm...+__

...+You're lucky I'm not afraid of needles...+__
I'm shooting this serum thing... in my arm...+__
...+__
...+__
I-+I think it worked!+ I don't feel pain anymore.+__
...+Looks like the door of the cage is open again too...+__

<(42)1 - What was that? Who shot that dart in the first place?__
]

[Scene 42 __
I...+ I don't remember where it came from.+__
But the fact that there was a serum to counter this venom in the first place is...+__
Yeah, I'm not here by coincidence.+ Someone's definitly trying to play with me.+__

<(44)1| - You're imagining things.__
<(47)2@ - You must be right.__
<(43)3| - GET OUT, HE'S OBSERVING YOU!__
]

[Scene 43 __
AAAAAAH! FOR GOD'S SAKE, YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT!+__
I don't need this kind of joke now!+ I need you to take this situation seriously.+__
Something is really after me and it's clear it's for no good...+__
You're right on one thing : I have to get out, AND FAST+__

<(49)1 - Wasn't there an exit door?__
]

[Scene 44 __
What do you mean I'm "imagining things"?+__
Do you think it was fake poison?+ Fake pain?+ Or maybe that this whole trap was set by the inca years ago?+__
I'm not going to listen to your opinion anyway.+ What I'm living is real...+__
Why are you trying to convince me otherwise?...+ Are you part of this?+__

<(45)1| - Here you go, imagining things again.__
<(46)2| - No! what would I benefit from this anyway?__
<(48)3 - Yes, I am.__
]

[Scene 45 __
Why would this phone call the biggest ASSHOLE ON EARTH TO HELP ME!+__
...+I don't care anyway.+ As long as you prevent me from dying like you did before I'm not going to complain...+__
But it might be good if you start acting like you see me as a human being instead of a clown for once.+__

<(49)1 - The biggest asshole on earth tells you to go check the exit door.__
]

[Scene 46 __
That's...+ That's...+ That's fair enough.+__
I can't come up with anything that would be logic at this point.+__
And you genuinly helped me there so...+__
Yeah, I guess I work with that for now.+__
So?+ It's time to get the fuck out of here before some bullshit puzzle happens again, right?+__

<(49)1 - How about that exit door from before?__
]

[Scene 47 __
If you're thinking the same as me, I think It's best if I follow my instinct and get out of here QUICK!+__

<(49) 1 - Wasn't there an exit door?__
]

[Scene 48 )__
I KNEW IT!+__
I’M SURE YOU CAN TRACK ME WITH THIS PHONE!+__

I-It means someone kicked it down while I was inside the glass enclosure...+__

<(50)1 - Let's enter!__
<(50)2 - That's freaking me out... Let's go back.__
]

[Scene 50 __
I mean...+ It might be better to go baAAAH WHAT THE FUCK!!!!+__
*running sounds*+__
...+__

<(51)1 - Hey? What happened? HEY?!__
]

[Scene 51 __
…Is it gone?+__
Oh.+ My.+ GOD!+__
THERE WAS A SILHOUETTE LURKING BEHIND ME IN THE VIVARIUM+__
I mechanicly ran through that damn door and got as far as possible+__

<(55)1 - I see... Where did you landed?__
<(52)2 - Can't you go back to the vivarium?__
]

[Scene 52 __
Uhm...+ No?+__
There’s two reasons for that.+__
Firstly, I don’t have a clue of the way back to the vivarium.+__
Secondly, THERE WAS A FREACKING MONSTER OUT THERE AND I DON’T WANT TO MEET IT AGAIN+__
Is that enough for you?__

<(53)1 - A monster you say?__
<(55)2 - Where are you now?__
]

[Scene 53 __
Y-Yeah...+ I can’t find another word to describe this thing.+__
I’m sure that it was not my imagination...+ I think...+__
...+Great, now you make me doubt of myself.+__

<(54)1 - What did it look like?__
]

[Scene 54 __
I only saw a silhoutte, but it was enough to activate my survival instinct.+__
This thing had human forms but something was clearly off, I don’t know what.+__
...+Why can’t I wake up from this nightmare?+__

<(55)1 - We'll get you out of here by moving forward.__
]

[Scene 55 __
Yes, uhm...+ I landed in some sort of tunnels.+__
It smells horrible, almost like the rotten food in the supermarket back then.+__
There are several different path in here.+__

<(56)1 - You're under the island! Maybe you can access other parts of the city from here.__
]

[Scene 56 __
That’s a good idea, but where should I go?+__
I have no idea where these paths will lead+__

<(57)1 - Huh? What did you say?__

[Scene 57 __

Why did you tell what?+ I thought I was being clear.+__

<(58)1 - I-Is there a code near you by any chance?__

So where should I go first?+__

[Scene 68 __
There's so much dust, I can't see anything!...+ Wait... It's getting more clear.+__
I-I'm in-OUCH!-...+in a white room.+ The lights work in here...+ There's a door at the back.+__
...I feel like I'm not welcome here.+__

<(69)1 - Can you get up and explore the place?__
]

[Scene 69 __
I'll try...+__
...+OH! That hurts...+ Okay... I'm standing up...+__
I guess you'll ask me what's behind the door right?+__

<(70)1 - You guessed it.__

[Scene 70 __
Here I go...+*door handle noise*+__
...+__
There's blood on the walls...+ I-It looks fresh...+__
This horrible odor...+ It smells more and more as I'm moving through the hallway...+__

"Oh! Why did they landed here? Did they die of pneumonia? How curious!"+__
NO, I'M SCARED, I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE!+__

Their face.+ They look dismorphed...__
...W-What?...+ It's impossible...+__
...+Why do they have the same clothes, the same body traits as...+ me?+ WHY DO THEY LOOK LIKE ME?!+__
It's just a nightmare oh my god+__

<(76)1 - Do I understand that... >84__

[Scene 74 __
I-I'm trying, but I'm terrified!+ There was some monster chasing me just before!+__
Now I'm inside this weird underground place filled with dead bodies looking all the same!+__

<(75)1 - What do you mean by looking all the same?__
]

[Scene 75 __
What do I mean?+ I mean they all wear the same clothes, have the same facial features, have the same body trai...+__
