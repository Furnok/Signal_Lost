Chapter-02(The Museum)/75\<1>
[Scene 1 \\__
Going to the museum?+ I can work with that.+__
This whole trapdoor thing is supicious anyway.+ It might be better to explore this place before doing anything stupid.+__

<(2)1 - How much time will it take to get there?__
]

[Scene 2 __
It's not that far away, I think I can even see it from here!+ I'll take you back in a second when I'll be there!+__
.+.+.+__
.+.+.+__
Okay!+ I'm in front of it.+ It's smaller than I thought, and it looks really well preserved!__

<(3)1 - Small?__
<(4)2 - Well preserved?__
]

[Scene 3 __
It looks like this place has only one big main room inside.+__
I don't know if there'll be anything interesting here...+__

<(14)1 - Well, you might as well go and see inside to be sure! ;13__
<(13)2 - Why are you doubting all of a sudden?__
]

[Scene 4 __
That's weird right?+__
All this place has is empty buildings withered by the time.+__
It's weird that a useless building is still standing unharmed.+__
...+Does that mean that someone's still here to assure this museum is clean?...+__

<(5)1@ - Nah. Why would someone want to clean an old museum anyway? It's a coincidence.__
<(6)2 - I guess there is, why would it be cleaner than the other building otherwise?__
]

[Scene 5 __
I'm sure you're right...+ But it feels odd, still.+__
I'm  
Great.+ Now I don't feel like entering this place.+__

<(6)1 - You're afraid of seeing someone now?__
<(7)2| - Well, don't enter it then.__
<(8)3 - Sorry to announce that, but it doesn't seem that you have the choice...__
]

[Scene 6 __
I guess I am...+ The fact that everything seems to be designed to make me explore this place is...+__
Yes, I'm scared...+__

<(9)1| - I knew it! You're chicken-hearted!__
<(8)2@ - Everything's gonna be fine as long as we collaborate.__
]

[Scene 7 __
I FEEL like not entering, but I have no choice and I think you know it well!+__
I-...+ I could do that but there's nothing that could help me escape that strikes my mind.+__

<(8)1@ - You're not in danger as long as I'm with you!__
<(9)2 - I knew you were chicken-hearted!__
]

[Scene 8 __
Exactly what I was thinking!...+__
Since I have no choice, let's enter slowly...+__
...*footsteps*+ *door squeak*+__
...+What is that?+__

<(15)1 - Is there something weird in here?__
]

[Scene 9 __
I'm chicken-hearted?+ Oh yeah?+__
Well, you know what?+ I'll enter this museum without you begging me for it!+__
*footsteps*+ *WHAM*+__
HEY!+ I JUST ENTERED YOUR MUSEUM BY KICKING THE DOOR! *echoes*+__

<(10)1| - Shhhh!! What if there's really someone here?__
<(11)2 - That's more like it!__
]

[Scene 10 __
What did I hear?+ Is someone getting scared all of the sudden?+ That'll teach you!+__
But there doesn't seem to be anyone here anyway.+__
Looks like we both worried for nothing.+__
...+But there still somthing off-putting here.__

<(15)1 - What makes you feel like that?__
]

[Scene 11 __
See?+ I can get cocky when I want!+ RIGHT?! *echoes*...+__
...+Yeah, no one's responding.+ Not that I'm disappointed anyway!+__
It's way better to know that there is no one lurking at me ahah!+__

<(12)1@ - Well... I am__
]

[Scene 12 __
That's fair, but you seem like a good guy.+__
I'm not going to be scared by a voice coming from an old flipphone!+__
But let's focus more on this museum now.+ Something's off.__

<(15)1 - What about it?__
]

[Scene 13 __
...+I don't think going inside the only building that looks inhabited is a good idea.+__
I don't want to land face to face with someone hostile.__

<(6)1 - You're afraid of seeing someone now?__
<(7)2| - Well, don't enter it then.__
<(8)3 - Sorry to announce that, but it doesn't seem that you have the choice...__
]

[Scene 14 __
If I would listen to me, I would not enter this place because it freaks me out for some reason...+__
But you're here! I've got nothing to be afraid of, so I'm heading inside!+__
*footsteps*+ *door squeak*...+__

<(15)1 - So? what's inside?__
]

[Scene 15 __
The inside of this museum truly feels abnormal...+__
Everything's clean, there's not a single bit of dust here!+__
All these paintings are perfectly displayed,+ sculptures are bright polished..+__
There's even historical relics preserved under glass bells!+__

<(16)1 - That's weird...__
<(17)2| - That's so cool!__
]

[Scene 16 __
It definitly!+ How can this museum be this clean?+__
Considering that it's the first time I see a place not post-apocalyptic-looking on this island...+__
It surely means that...+__

<(18)1| - ...you're becoming paranoïd?__
<(19)2 - ...someone's living here?__
<(20)3@ - ...that we have a new mystery to resolve!__
]

[Scene 17 __
...+No, it isn't?+__
It's unsettling...+ Every place I've been through on this island has only been ruins and now that!+__
It most defintly means that this place is special somehow...+__

<(18)1| - You're definitly becoming paranoïd__
<(19)2 - Is... someone living here?__
<(20)3@ - Seems that we'll have to solve this mystery together!__
]

[Scene 18 __
...+What?+ Wouldn't you be paranoïd after going through what I'm living?+__
I'd like us to switch place and see how you could manage all this...+__
How would you like that idea?+__

<(21)1| - I think I would be braver than you!__
<(22)2@ - I think I'd manage things like you__
<(23)3 - I'd be... more fearful than you...__
]

[Scene 19 __
Oh freak...+ It means my instinct didn't betray me?+__
Do you think it's here? Observing me from a corner?+__
*heavy brething*...+ I think I'm going to throw up...+__

<(24)1@ - Calm Down.That doesn't justify any panic__
<(25)2| - Don't throw up on the art please__
<(26)3| - I was joking around! There's surely not anyone here__
]

[Scene 20 __
...+I didn't expected that kind of answer but it feels weirdly refreshing!+__
It's nice having someone dedramatizing this whole situation.+__
Let's go and solve that mystery then! Where should I go?+__

<(27)1 - What is around you again?__
]

[Scene 21 __
That's a bold thing to say!+__
You're really are a daredevil huh?+__ Well I'm not, and you'll have to bare with it.+__
To refocus on what's important, I think exploring this room might be helpful.+__

<(27)1 - What is around you again?__
]

[Scene 22 __
You see?+ I guess we're not so different after all!+__
Now, this ideological question is interesting but it won't help me to escape from here, so let's explore this place!+__

<(27)1 - What is around you again?__
]

[Scene 23 __
AH!+ You get all showy while you couldn't handle a quarter of what I'm living!+__
...+I'm the one making fun of you but in the end I'm still the one stucked on this island...+ Ironic.+__
It might be the right time to come back at the main question : What is this place?+__

<(27)1 - What is around you again?__
]

[Scene 24 __
...*phew*+ ...That's true.+__
I'm not in imminent danger...+ I must focus on my escape and everything will be okay!+__
I needed to reassure myself before doing a bit of exploration, sorry.+__

<(27)1 - What is around you again?__
]

[Scene 25 __
Huh?+ *heavy breathing*+ I don't care about the art!+__
You know it's really not the time to be joking around, right?+__
I'm diving into the unknown and you think it's funny?+ That's really irritating!+__
I don't want to argue here, so let's go see what this museum has to offer.+__

<(27)1 - What is around you again?__
]

[Scene 26 __
Well, I hope you're not a humorist!+__
You know it's really not the time to be joking around, right?+__
I'm diving into the unknown and you think it's funny?+ That's really irritating!+__
I don't want to argue here, so let's go see what this museum has to offer.+__

<(27)1 - What is around you again?__
]

[Scene 27 __
There are paintings on the wall, from the impressionism era it seems.+__
There's also all these sculptures of muscular men.+ The greek heterocurious kind of sculpture, you know.+__
And there's also these rock plates with strange language engraved on them.+__

<(28)1 - Go and see the paintings__
<(29) 2 - Go and see the sculpture__
<(30) 3 - Go and see the inscriptions on the rock__
]

[Scene 28 __
*footsteps*...+ The paintings are all representation of a city!+__
Seems like the keeper of this museum really liked it.+ I can see similar features between all of them.+__

<(31)1 - Is there something else than art here?__
<(39)2 - Can you describe it more precisely?__
]

[Scene 29 __
*footsteps*...+ Oh wow! They look even more muscular from close!+__
These stony guys are fighting reeaaaal good!+__

<(31)1 - Is there something else than art here?__
<(40)2 - Can you describe it more precisely?__
]

[Scene 30 __
*footsteps*...+ It's a really good looking rock, with good looking inscriptions on it!+__
Too bad I can't speak that language tho.+__

<(31)1 - Is there something else than art here?__
<(41)2 - Can you describe it more precisely?__
]

[Scene 31 __
I thought the same thing...+ I'm not here to appreciate the beauty of hand-made art.+__
I'm here to GET OUT OF THIS ISLAND!+ FUCK YOU, ART!+__
*CRACK*+ Shit, I didn't know kicking a statue could dislock it's leg-*RUMBLE*...+ Huh?+__

<(32)1 - What's going on?__
]

[Scene 32 __
I-I don't know, the ground shaked for a second...+__
Wait...+ What's tha-...+__
...Has a motherfucking door appeared at the back of the museum?+__
Did I really activated a mechanism at random because of my rage?+__

<(33)1 - It must be a secret escape!__
<(33)2 - Watch out, it might be trapped__
]

[Scene 33 __
I don't know, but I'm too curious to not go and see what this damn door is all about!+__
*footsteps*...+ SHIT! It's locked!+__
There's a keypad attached to it.+ And it's weird but...+ there are letters here instead of numbers.+__
Oh!+ And here you go, another post-it!+ I start to identify a leitmotiv in these puzzles...+__

<(34)1 - Can you read it for me?__
]

[Scene 34 __
"IN CASE THE MADNESS MAKES YOU FORGET:+__
-FIRST LETTER = CITY NAME+__
-SECOND LETTER = ARTIST NAME+__
-THIRD LETTER = TRANSLATED IN ENGLISH+__
KEEP EVERYONE OUT AT ALL COST"+__

<(45)1 - I think I might have an idea for the code__
<(35)2 - What is there in the museum again?__
]

[Scene 35 __
There are paintings on the wall, from the impressionism era it seems.+__
There's also all these sculptures of muscular men.+ The greek heterocurious kind of sculpture, you know.+__
There's also these rock plates with strange language engraved on them.+__
And obviously this weird door with that letter keypad and the note.+__

<(36)1 - Go and see the paintings__
<(37)2 - Go and see the sculpture__
<(38)3 - Go and see the inscriptions on the rock__
<(38)4 - Can I see the note again?__
]

[Scene 36 __
*footsteps*...+ The paintings are all representation of a city!+__
Seems like the keeper of this museum really liked it.+ I can see similar features between all of them.+__

<(42)1 - Can I have more information about it?__

[Scene 38 __
*footsteps*...+ It's a really good looking rock, with good looking inscriptions on it!+__
Too bad I can't speak that language tho.+__

<(44)1 - Can I have more information about it?__
]

[Scene 39 __
It's multiple painting picturing the same city it seems!+__
I can tell that because of the same looking monument one every of them.+__
It's a huge white pillar with at the top a golden urn of fire, or something like that.+__

<(27)1 - What else is here?__
]

[Scene 40 __
It's a white statue of two men fighting.+__
Well, I said two men but not really.+ One is a centaur if I'm not mistaking.+__
The human one is on top of him with a huge stick, ready to strike the centaur.+__
That's a cool looking statue!+__

<(27)1 - What else is here?__
]

[Scene 41 __
It's a flat piece of rock with engravings on it.+__
It seems to be a dead language I don't know how to read.+__
There is one word on here that's colored in red.+__
It reads "effingo".+ I hope I pronounced it properly.+__

<(27)1 - What else is here?__
]

[Scene 42 __
It's multiple painting picturing the same city it seems!+__
I can tell that because of the same looking monument one every of them.+__
It's a huge white pillar with at the top a golden urn of fire, or something like that.+__

<(35)1 - Can you say again what's in here?__

[Scene 43 __
It's a white statue of two men fighting.+__
Well, I said two men but not really.+ One is a centaur if I'm not mistaking.+__

[Scene 45 __
Are you sure?+ I don't know what could happen if I type the wrong code but I don't want to find out.+__
You're confident?+__

<(46)1 - Hell yeah, show me this keypad!__
<(35)2 - Wait... Can we just check the museum again?__
]

[Scene 46 __
Okay, what first letter should I type?+__
it's the "CITY NAME" thing, right?+__

<(49)1 - P__
<(49)2 - S__
<(49)3 - A__
<(47)4 - L__
<(49)5 - O__
]

[Scene 47 __
...+I'm shaking of fear, but I need to concentrate to click on the right button...+__
*b#ip*...+__
Oh yes! it didn't explode or anything, so we may be on the right path!+__
The second letter was "ARTIST NAME".+__

<(48)1 - G__
<(49)2 - L__
<(49)3 - D__
<(49)4 - W__
<(49)5 - Y__
]

[Scene 48 __
If I die because of this, I'll kill you, remember that...+__
*b#ip*...+__
Another success!+ You're really good at that!+__
Now for the last letter, it's "TRANSLATED IN ENGLISH".+__

<(49)1 - E__
<(49)2 - S__
<(49)3 - R__
<(49)4 - U__
<(52)5 - C__

*BU#ZZ*...+ That wasn't a reassuring sou-__

...W-+What?+ What does that even mean?+__
*cough*+ You gave me the wrong letter!+__
*cough*+ Why is everything get-*cough*+ getting blurry?+__

<(50)1 - You have to get out!__
]

[Scene 50 \__
*cough COUGH*+__
I c...*cough*+ I can't breath!+__
*cough*+ *COUGH COUGH*+__

[Scene 52 __
Please be right, please be right, please be right...+__
*b#ip*...+__
*CLICK*+ The door... is unlocked!+__
I don't know what I'll find here, but I'm going inside anyway..+__
*door squeak*+__

<(53)1 - What are you expecting to find here?__
]

[Scene 53 __
For now, all is see are stairs going deep down...+__
But I hope that I'll found this fuse to activate the trapdoor in the outside.+__
Or at least answers for why I'm here.+__

<(54)1 - What if you don't find any fuse?__
<(58)2 - What if there was someone down there?__
<(61)3 - What if it's a trap?__
]

[Scene 54 __
That's not reassuring to say pal...+__
What if there's no fuse?+ Guess I'll die slowly, starving, while you're here listening to my agony.+__
Would you be here to support here in my final moments?+__

<(55)1@ - Of course! I will be with you until the end__
<(56)2| - Uhm, I have more alluring stuff to do__
<(57)3@ - Sorry but I don't feel confortable with hearing someone slowly dying on phone...__
]

[Scene 55 __
Ahah!+ That was supposed to be a joke!+__
I admit  that I won't be able to handle that on side anyway.+__
But if you're willing to hear me die, I guess that's okay!+ If that's not because of a twisted fantasy of yours...+__

<(64)1 - I was just being honest! You're down the stairs?__
]

[Scene 56 __
Oh.+ Uhm...+__
Of course you have a life, I don't want to disturb you with my boring imminent death...+__

<(64)1 - It's cool to see that you understand! You're down the stairs?__
]

[Scene 57 __
Ahah!+ Of course you're not!+ That was a joke!+__
Don't worry about it, if I ever find myself in this kind of situation, I don't you to suffer it too.+__

<(64)1 - Funny one. You're down the stairs?__
]

[Scene 58 __
...+If we put together the door system and the tidiness of this museum compared to the other buildings...+__
Yes, I think I'm about to meet the ones responsible of all my troubles.+__
I don't know what their project is, but I'm sure I'll soon find out if I speak directly to them.+__

<(59)1| - But they'll be hostile!__
<(60)2 - Maybe we can deal so they free you__
]

[Scene 59 __
Don't you think that I considered this possibility?+__
Of course they don't want me to go!+ But I have nothing to stop them other than trying to talk them out.+__
Hostile or not, here I come!+__

<(64)1 - Where ar you now?__
]

[Scene 60 __
That's what I thought.+__
If they put me there in the first place, there is a reason, and I don't they did all of that just for fun.+__
There is a meaning behind all of this mess I've been through and I want to know about it.+__
And if they can free me in the process, it would be nice too.+__

<(64)1 - Where ar you now?__
]

[Scene 61 __
I guess I'll be jumping right into it then!+__
I have no choice anyway. It's my only hope to get out of this island.+__

<(62)1| - I would go back and search for another way out if I were you__
<(63)2 - Do whatever you want, it's your responsability__
]

[Scene 62 __
Too bad you're not me and that I can make decisions on my own!+__
I've been on this island for hours and I know there is no way out outside.+__
It's too late to change my mind.+__

<(64)1 - So you're getting down there?__
]

[Scene 63 __
Yes, it is, and I totally understand that I'll be the only one responsible for the consequences of this decision.+__
But I still count on you to help me here.+__

<(64)1 - I'll do my best... Where are you now?__
]

[Scene 64 \__
I'm down the stairs.+ It see-*SHKRRRRRRRRRR*+__
There's multiple corridor leading to-*SHKRRRRRRRRRR*...+ I don't know which one is the right one!+__

I...+ I heard everything.+__
Were you sincere while answering these questions?+__

<(76)2| - I was not__
]

[Scene 75 __
Wow!+ I knew you were someone I could trust!+__
But who was the one asking you these questions?__

<(78)1 - I have no idea!__
]

[Scene 76 __
Yeah, as if you could pretend that!+__
Anyway, let's focus on the most important question : WHO WAS THAT?+__

<(78)1 - I have no idea!__
]

[Scene 77 __
Are you serious?...+__
You know what forget it...+ The most important think is who the fuck was this person asking you all this?+__

<(78)1 - I have no idea!__
]

[Scene 78 __
Of course you don't...+__
The more I realise the situation I'm in, the less I think all of this makes sense...+__
Anyway, I'm inside a complex of whitish corridors, the-*footsteps*...+__
Wait...+ Those footsteps weren't mine...__

<(79)1 - HIDE!__
]

[Scene 79 __
*footsteps* It's getting closer!__
*SLAM*...+__
I locked myself inside a room...+ I think I'm safe n-__
&It's useless to hide you know?+ I know where you are at all time=+__

<(80)1 - Who is this?__
<(80)2 - Don't say a word!__
]

[Scene 80 __
&No matter what your friend says, it's just between me and you subject 835...=+__
&You bypassed what I've prepared for you by entering the museum. It never happened before!=+__
W-Who are you calling subject 835?__

<(81)1 - DON'T TALK TO HIM!__
<(81)2 - Is this the one who put you on this island?__
]

[Scene 81 __
&Subject 835?+ That's you of course!=+__
&You're no more than a pale copy of the one you're calling on this phone right now.=+__
W-Wait...+ What?+ A copy you say?+__
&A clone, if you prefer this term.=+__

<(82)1 - Y-You're a clone of me?__
]

[Scene 82 __
No...+ It's impossible!+ YOU'RE LYING!+__
&...I expected this kind of reaction.+ Why do you think you and the original behind this call have the same voice?=+__
&Didn't it strike you at first that he was the only contact on this phone?=+__

<(83)1 - He's lying!__
]

[Scene 83 __
&I'm telling you the truth.+ It might seem troubling but you have to accept that you're just a mere reproduction.=+__
&But why would it matter?+ You're now the perfect subject I was waiting for.=+__
...+What do you mean by...+ The perfect subject?+__

&Do you think I prepared all of this for fun?=+__

<(85)1 - All the clones before died?...__

[Scene 85 __
&Not all.+ I just said that you were subject 835.+ 3 are still alive to this day.=+__
&One was not able to handle the virus. However he managed to take out his tracker and he's still roaming outside.=+__
&He was responsible for the death of some clones because of his hostility.=+__
&The other one was immune, but he managed to bypass my security and to free himself.=+__

<(87)1 - Virus? Immune?__
<(87)2 - Is that the one who contacted me earlier? Or was it you?__

&I understand your confusion.+ But the survival of humankind is at stake at this very moment.=+__
&A virus is spreading, and it's undetectable.+ I called it the Emotoxin.+ No one believed me.=+__
&It decuplates the instensity of our emotions, causing us to burst out of rage, euphoria or feel miserable.=+__
...+And in what way could this cause the end of humankind?+__

<(88)1 - Yes! Why should we trust you?__
]

[Scene 88 __
&You should see how an infected acts.=+__
&In our world filled with hate, it would cause people to kill each other over a small argument.=+__
...+I'm not infected right?+ So why would you do all that in the first place!+__
Why not use a lab rat instead of killing HUNDREDS OF HUMANS!+__

<(89)1 - AND WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE ME?!__
]

[Scene 89 __
&The Emotoxin only affects humans. So I preffered to base my search on clones instead of real humans.=+__
&I chose to clone you because your DNA was highly compatible with cloning and resistent to the Emotoxin structure.=+__
&All these puzzles were tests to see if you were affected by the toxin by playing with your emotions.=+__
&I think it might be time to get out of this room now.+ I need your blood.=+__

I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU SUCK MY BLOOD!+ I MAY BE A CLONE BUT I'M NOT BELIEVING ALL THIS SHIT!+__
