Chapter-04(The Factory)/50\<1>  —  ’  …  :
[Scene 1 \\__
Yeah.+ Of all places, the factory seems like the place I could find answers and the key to my escape.+__
I'll go there if I can.+ Let's go.+__
*footsteps*+__

<(2)1 - What exactly do you mean by key? ;3__
<(9)2 - If you can? Would there be anything preventing you? ;10__
]

[Scene 2 __
With how much all of this looks like a setup, I might find the fuse there.+__
I just don't get why whoever is keeping me in this place left a working phone back in the supermarket.+__
I'm just playing their game at this point.+__
*footsteps*+__

<(8)1 - That's a pain of a situation for sure.__
]

[Scene 3 __
...+ I hope I can find the fuse, why are you asking?__
*footsteps*+__

<(7)1 - Of course. Just making sure.__
<(4)2 - Are you... alright?__
]

[Scene 4 __
I...+ I'm just really stressed-+__
...+__
Listen, I might have found this phone but I don't feel like you're here to help...+__
I don't know, you've got to put yourself in my place a bit...+__
*footsteps*+__

<(7)1 - You're right, let's both calm down and work together.__
<(7)2 - I'm sorry, I wasn't expecting a call like that.__
<(5)3@ - It's my fault, I behaved like an idiot.__
]

[Scene 5 __
You- I mean, you know- I get it.+__
It's hard to handle some random person calling you for seemingly no reason.+__
...+__
But thanks for admitting that, I already feel safer if you're able to show a bit of self-awareness+__

<(6)1 - We're cool then!__
]

[Scene 6 __
We are.+__
...+__
I've arrived to the entrance, but I have to get through a fence.+__
It seems really fragile, so getting rid of it wouldn't be that hard.+ That thing's already quite damaged.+__
...+__
Or I could go around, there's no reason for a building like this not to have some kind of backdoor.+__

<(138)1 - Yeah, get rid of that thing.__
<(16)2 - Yeah, go for a backdoor.__
]

[Scene 7 __
Alright...+__
...+__
There's a metal fence around the entrance.+__
I should be able to push it, but going around and finding another entrance might be easier.+__

<(138)1 - Yeah, get rid of that thing.__
<(16)2 - Yeah, go for a backdoor.__
]

[Scene 8 __
Kind of...+ Yeah.+__
...+__
I got closer to the building, enough to realise the entrance's blocked by a fence.+__
It looks brittle enough, but getting around might also be easier,__
it only seems to block the main entrance.+__

<(138)1 - Let's not waste time, try and push the fence.__
<(16)2 - You should try to find a backdoor.__
]

[Scene 9 __
There seem to be a fence in front of the main entrance.+__
I probably could get around and find another way to enter,__
but from this distance it looks really thin and rusted,__
I think pushing it down and getting over would prove quite easy.+__
What do you think?+__

<(138)1 - Yeah let's do that!__
<(16)2 - Maybe you should go around, you might find something interesting.__
]

[Scene 10 __
Do you expect something to block me? Why would you ask me that?+__

<(11)1 - I'm being serious. You wouldn't use conditional if you were sure.__
<(12)2 - Is there something wrong?__
]

[Scene 11 __
I got myself a smart one, uh?+__
I'm being conditional 'cause there's a fence surrounding the entrance.+__
Either have to get around or through it.+__

<(16)1 - Get Around it.__
<(138)2 - Get through it.__
]

[Scene 12 __
Oh-+ Yeah...+__
...+
I expected to feel better with someone else on the other end of the phone...+ But I-+__
You know...+ It's hard...+
*footsteps*+__

<(15)1 - It's hard for the both of us.__
<(13)2@ - I shouldn't have said those things.__
<(15)3 - I get that, I'm sorry.__
]

[Scene 13 __
I-+ I get it.+__
It's good you're able to put yourself in my place a bit.+ Thanks for acknowledging it.+__
I'm starting to feel a bit more hopeful about getting out of here if you're on my side.+__

<(14)1 - Yeah, let's not rest.__
]

[Scene 14 __
I'm getting there.+ But I can already see the place's protected by a fence.+__
It isn't a big deal, I could probably find another entrance.+__
*footsteps*+__
The metal looks brittle. I probably could bend it down and get over it.+__
What do you think?+__

<(16)1 - I like the idea of finding another entrance better.__
<(138)2 - If you can do it, cross the fence.__
]

[Scene 15 __
Hm-+ Anyways, there's a fence blocking the way to the main entrance.+__
I can either try and get through or go around.+__
It looks weak enough to be bent, but this kind of buildings tend to have backdoors.+__

<(138)1 - You should break the fence.__
<(16)2 - I'd go around.__
]

[Scene 16 __
Yeah. The main entrance might be trapped, I'd rather find another way.+__
*footsteps*+__
Thinking outside the box might be the way to avoid some of the-+ ...+ psycho+ keeping me here's-+ games.+__

<(17)1 - Exactly my thought.__
<(18)2 - Let's hope backdoors aren't either...__
]

[Scene 17 __
Good to know we're on the same line.+__
...+__
I know it sounds weird, but...+ I really like the slight breeze on this island.+__
If it wasn't covered in trash and dull concrete, it'd be almost habitable.+__
I almost regret not going for a walk in the zoo,__
but I really need to find food and I'm not about eating a raw giraffe.+__

<(19)1 - Not like you'd find anything alive anyways.__
<(19)2 - Zoos are smelly.__
]

[Scene 18 __
...+ No need to make me doubt...+__
If that bastard really wants me to die I'm screwed anyways. Might as well minimize the risk.+__
...+__
Who knows...He might be an idiot+__

<(20)1 - I'd doubt that. They probably built this place.__
<(19)2 - I mean... This island has a zoo and a museum but no hopistal.__
]

[Scene 19 __
Talking about the zoo, guess what.+ It's awfully close to this place.+__
I can see the inside of the enclosures from there.+__
Whoever designed this city should be fired.+ Or even set on fire.+__
Because I'm stuck inside their shittily designed city.+__
That prick.+__
#%*Distorted chuckle*=#+__
#%Th  +re  Bet er off there wit+  me thAn aloNe in thE ZoO.=#+__

<(23)1 - Who's that? What experiments?__
<(21)2 - Good one. Have you found an entrance yet?__
]

[Scene 20 __
Wouldn't be trying to defend them+, would we?+__
Errm-+ Anyways.+__
Didn't realize the zoo was that close to the factory before.+ Civil engineering failed some.+__
#%DaNgeROus+ Pl cE.+ EXpE iments.=#+__

<(23)1 - What's that about experiments? And still no idea who %you= are.__
<(21)2 - It sure did. Did you find anything?__
]

[Scene 21 __
Empty drums, debris, nothing but the usual shit.+__
Nowhere else to go, you see, so for now I'll keep looking.+__
Stressed out and hungry I feel, still haven't got anything to eat+__
I could really use oat meal, or anything that would get me going.+__

<(22)1 - I'm sure you'll find something to gnaw on once inside.__
<(22)2 - Did you just... rap?__
]

[Scene 22 __
You're-+__
There's something written on the wall.+__
...+__
Please don't be scary.+__
...+__
Oh god.+__

<(31)1 - What does it say?__
]

[Scene 23 __
M-+ Me?+ As I've said before I-__

- once again, I do NOT know why I'm here nor about any kind of experiments, just help me, alright?+__

<(24)1 - I'm not talking to you, there's someone in the call__
<(24)2 - Jeez, fix your signal.__
]

[Scene 24 __
What? Who are you talking to?+ You're really starting to freak me out.+__
#%cAN+t SaY M Re. Conn cTION unst+ BLE. YoU'lL gET +c+LoSER.=#+__

<(28)1 - Someone's interfering. They say they want to help you.__
<(25)2| - Don't worry__
]

[Scene 25 __
Of course I'm going to worry!!!+__
You're giving me no explanation after saying shit about some experiment. Are there more people with you?+__
...+__
You're always alternating between reinsuring and cryptic, talking to the fucking voices now!+__
Am-+ Am I a game to you? Are you going to fucking tell?!+__

<(26)1 - Listen! I'm confused, there's this person-__
<(22)2 - Just keep walking, for fuck's sake.__
<(137)3 - Well, actually it is.__
]

[Scene 26 __
And... You're just gonna say that now?+__
Uh... Nevermind. I'm not even gonna ask anymore.+__
.+.+.+__
But should we reaaally trust them?+__
I mean, why would anyone other than the person behind all of this try to talk to you,__
and why can't I hear them?+__

<(27)1 - They seem to interfere with the outgoing signal, hence why you don't hear it.__
<(27)2 - Hard to understand what they're saying. They'd need you to get closer.__
]

[Scene 27 __
Which means...+ They're on the island.+__
Great.+__
That either means a helping hand... Or extra danger.+__
As if all of this needed more complexity.+__
So they're going to help you guide me if I understood well.+__
Doesn't sound like a trap.+__

<(29)1 - We'll see. Let's try to listen to them for now.__
<(28)2 - You're screwed either way if that's the case. Might as well tempt it.__
<(28)1 - I'm still there. Don't worry. ;29__
]

[Scene 28 __
Yeah...+ I know.+__
Let's just think positively!+ Everything's...+ Fine.+__
New hope.+ Island friend.+ Good news aaall around.+__

<(30)1@- Getting the spirit!__
<(30)2@- Feeling better?__
]

[Scene 29 __
Uuh-+ Sure...+__
...+__
I'll-__

<(30)1 - Just keep going.__
<(30)2 - Trust me!__
]

[Scene 30 __
Of course.__
Let's just start m-+__
...+__
Writings.+__
Writings on the wall.+ Please.+ Why.+__
Oh no, don't tell me these are creepy letters-+__
On the wall.+ I'm so sick.+__

<(31)1 - What does it say?__
]

[Scene 31 __
"THEY FED ME MY OWN SELF".+__
I...+ Really don't want to discover what happened on this island.+__
...+__
I'm almost surprised that wasn't written in blood. Although blue blood might be a thing on this island.+__
I dont know, I'm not a...+ ...blood+ ...scientist.+__

<(32)1 - What does that mean?__
<(33)1 - Who do you think did it?__
]

[Scene 32 __
It really feels like some edgy shit a fourteen years old would write.+__
...+__
But I'm still shaken up despite how ridiculous that is...+__
Like...+ Someone wrote that in some place in the middle of the ocean.+__
I'm not gonna mess with a fourteen year old, not matter how angsty,__
if they're ready to cross the ocean for a joke.+__

<(34)1 - Yup, I really don't know.__
]

[Scene 33 __
I dunno. Maybe your friend did it.__
#%I diDn't=#  *static* #%onE Of thE   +-Ures=#+__

<(34)1 - Apparently they didn't.__
<(34)2 - Their connection is shit! I have no idea what a '-Ures' is.__
]

[Scene 34 __
Well me neither.__
Let's just move on knowing some lunatic could jump me any minute.+__
No big deal.+__

<(35)1 - It's just a matter of grabbing the fuse and leaving.__
<(35)2 - Probably there as part of the game, just keep walking.__
]

[Scene 35 __
So no big deal as I said.+__
...+__
Good news, I just stumbled onto what seems to be...+ fire escape stairs?+__
I'm positive these lead inside the building.+__
Chance might be on our side. And I'm not unhappy with doing a bit of exercise.+__

<(36)1 - So, what's up?__
]

[Scene 36 __
I'm cl-+ Oh-+__
Hold on a minute will you... I'm not a...+ ...stair climbing+ ...Athlete. +__
I'm...+ getting there...+__
Huff...Huff...__
.+.+.+__
Guess what.+__

<(37)1 - ...__
<(37)2 - What.__
]

[Scene 37 __
Remember when I talked about luck being on my side?+ Shouldn't have said that.+__
It's fricking closed. By a 3-digit pad, which isn't high protection by any means__
but I'd rather go back to the entrance than spend my time here.+__

<(39)1 - If it's a game, there must be a clue somewhere.__
<(38)2 - Let's go back and push that fence.__
]

[Scene 38 __
...+__
Y'know what, that was a joke.+ I ain't coming back down again.+__
There's a window on the door, might as well check if it's even worth it.+__
It's...+ Messy...+ Some sort of office.+__
I can see a wrench on the ground, and a door probably leading to the inside of the factory.+__
We gotta get that door open.+ That wrench looks sick.+__

<(40)1 - What's on the left?__
<(42)2 - What's on the right?__
]

[Scene 39 __
If there's a clue anywhere, it'd be inside.+__
Good thing the door has a window,+ worse case scenario I might just smash it and slither in like a...+__
...tapeworm.+__
The place looks like it was left in a hurry a dozen of year ago.+__
Someone even smeared their coffee on the carpet.+__
And what's that?+__
A random wrench laying on the ground?+ Now that's a motivator. Might have to bash some skull.+__

<(40)1 - Anything on the left?__
<(42)2 - Anything on the right?__
]

[Scene 40 __
Huuuh... There's a cork board with a bunch of blank pieces of paper pinned onto it...+__
And a literal passcode note. 7734.+__
Which is 4 digits so it's useless, are you kidding me.+__

<(41)1 - Definitely there on purpose! What's on the right?__
]

[Scene 41 __
The only thing on the right wall is a big mirror with...+__
An upside-down calculator taped onto it.+__
You know, the old ones we had back in school, those ones with the segmented digits.+__
Nostalgic, but not helping me that much.+__

<(44)1 - Okay, try this.__
]

[Scene 42 __
On the right?+ There's a mirror on the wall, and it has...__
An upside-down calculator taped onto it.+__
Old school ones, with segmented digit displays.+__
It's cool that it brings memories, but it's so useless right now.+__

<(43)1 - Too specific to mean nothing, look to the left.__
]

[Scene 43 __
There's a cork board covered in blank papers.+__
Oh yeah, also the passcode.+ 7734.+__
Hold it! The lockpad is 3 digits so it won't fit! *demented laugh* +__

<(44)1 - Calm down and try this.__
]

[Scene 44 __
Sure. First digit?__

<(46)1 - 3__
<(46)2 - 4__
<(45)3 - 6__
<(46)4 - 7__
]

[Scene 45 __
Then?__

<(48)1 - 3__
<(48)2 - 4__
<(47)3 - 6__
<(48)4 - 7__
]

[Scene 46 __
Then?__

<(48)1 - 3__
<(48)2 - 4__
<(48)3 - 6__
<(48)4 - 7__
]

[Scene 47 __
Click. Then?__

<(50)1 - 3__
<(50)2 - 4__
<(49)3 - 6__
<(50)4 - 7__
]

[Scene 48 __
Click. Then?__

<(50)1 - 3__
<(50)2 - 4__
<(50)3 - 6__
<(50)4 - 7__
]

[Scene 49 __
And we got it open. +666. What kind of protection is that?+__
How'd you figure that out?+__

<(51)1@- Remembered good ol' 5318008.__
<(52)2 - A friend helped.__
<(53)3|- Are you dense?__
]

[Scene 50 __
Nope. Not opening.__
#%Nev+ fliPped a calcuLa+toR bEFore?=#+__
7734, upside-down calculator, can you work something out with this?.+__

<(44)1 - Okay, let's try something else.__
]

[Scene 51 __
Oh yes!+ I remember that!+__
Never thought something that stupid could come in handy in a life or death situation.+__
Well of course I did but come on!+__
That's just so ridiculous, the person who designed this puzzle has to be a moron.+__

<(54)1 - Yeah definit-__
<(54)2 - Hey! I-__
<(54)3 - I thought you'd worry about the satan stu-__
]

[Scene 52 __
Wow, well guess they're not so bad, everything's good in the best of worlds!+__
Sorry, I'm being way too sarcastic, thank them.+ But also ask them how they knew the passcode.+__

<(55)1 - Actually, they didn-__
<(53)2 - They simply hinted m-__
]

[Scene 53 __
Wow, no need to be rude about it-+__
I'm more focused on survival than some stupid calculator cypher.+__

<(54)1 - You don't seem to str-__
<(54)2 - Still kinda du-__
]

[Scene 54 __
GOOD!+ Let's not waste anymore time!+__
We're finally in after all!+__
Maybe going through the main entrance would have been faster, but at least I got to breathe fresh air.+__
*THUD*+__
Oh, yes.+__
I also get to pick that beautiful wrench.+__

<(55)1 - Do you even know how to use it?__
<(55)2 - Shh. You might get hurt.__
<(56)3 - Nice.__
]

[Scene 55 __
B-+ BAHAHAHA-+__
Who do you take me for? I'm not a toddler, I can tighten bolts!__
My kidnapper might just come and catch these hands right now.+__
With this bad boy with me, I ain't loosing to no monster.+__
...+__

<(56)1 - Oh, ok, you seem to be feeling better.__
<(56)2 - Are... Are you sure?__
]

[Scene 56 __
Absolutely!+ __
...+__
... I don't know how to put it but it seems...+ advanced.+__
This ain't ordinary wrench. It's heavier and equiped with some kind of display.+__
...+__
I might take it home.+__

<(57)1 - You quirky little thief.__
<(57)2 - Keep your prize.__
]

[Scene 57 __
I'm only stealing my freedom back after all.+__
The other door is locked, and the latch seems to be stuck.+ +__
*Hammering sounds*+__
But that's a puzzle for another day, I've got places to be.+__
...+__
That thing packs a severe punch, I got it opened in a few hits.+__
*door creaks*+__

<(58)1 - Did you open the door?__
<(58)2 - What's inside?__
]

[Scene 58 __
It is w-+ way colder in here than outside.__
*voice echoes*+__
This place is huge.+ I'm in a hallway so long I can't see the other side.__
It really feels like I'm standing in front of a void,__
with only the echo of my voice proving me there's something that way.+__
And these big tubes...+ This place isn't for making shoes, that's for sure.+__

<(59)1 - How big exactly?__
<(60)2 - How many are there?__
]

[Scene 59 __
About my size.+ They're all connected to a dense net of wires on the ground.+__
Almost makes it hard to navigate.+__
Also smells quite odd.+ It's both off-putting...+ And weirdly conforting...+__
#%He's pLaying wi  yoU. WhY+ briNG=# +*static*+ #%Up?=#+__

<(61)1 - To the person interfering, what's that about?__
<(62)2 - Are you... alright?__
]

[Scene 60 __

Hard to tell, it goes way past what I'm physically able to see or even reach.+__
It's an... +...+ overwhelming view...+ This looks like a scene from a Science-fiction movie.+__

I don't know how trustworthy this person is,__
but this place is making me so sick I won't stay for a second more.+__
So I'll just do the next best thing .+__

<(66)1 - Wait. Where are you going?__
]

[Scene 66 __
Down the vent system. I just need to get it open.+__

What?+ You didn't expect me to try something while you're listening to their ramblings?+__

[Scene 67 __
Absolutely.+__
You know how nothing works like it's supposed to on this island?+__
The grid istelf is its own uncomprenhensible enigma.+__
In fact, it isn't a grid.+__
More like a lid with a big bolt.+__

<(78)1 - Use wrench on big bolt.__

Clicked-+ WAAH-__
*CLANG*+__
...+__
The uncomprehensible enigma came off and almost crushed my foot.+__
Let's see what's in there...+ It's... +Been cleaned recently?+__
So much for an abandoned building,+ the metal's almost glistening.+__

<(80)1 - Not even gonna react to me skillfully handling that puzzle? ;79__
]

[Scene 79 __
...+__
Wow, impressive.+__
I should kiss your feet even, you're the king of puzzles.+__

<(81)1 - Always glad to help...__
]

[Scene 80 __
Should I be surprised?+__
You've been quite effective thus far!+__
I'm being sarcastic a lot of the time but I actually really appreciate you sticking with me.+__
Even though you're painfully oblivious to my level of intelligence.+__

<(81)1 - Always glad to help!__
]

[Scene 81 __
Anyways, I'm getting into the...+hnng-+ ...vent.+__
I've got some crawling to do.+__
...+__
The odor's already fading, I can feel my chest getting lighter.+__
Despite it being squished between four steel walls.+__

<(82)1 - Things are looking up!__
<(83)2 - Getting there already?__
]

[Scene 82 __
For what being forced to crawl through a vent by a faceless sadist could have been+, kind of.+__
...+__
I can hear air flowing through another vent nearby.+__
So there is functionnal ventilation on this island, huh.+__
Might have been more effective if that one wasn't converted into a parkour tunnel for me to enjoy.+__

<(84)1 - Probably, yes.__
]

[Scene 83 __
I'm sure you can wait for a bit longer.+__
I'm not a...+ ...vent crawling+ ...expert.+__
...+__
I hear clicking and clanking all around, machinery doing its thing.+__
I thought this island was abandoned, but it's becoming more and more evident at least someone lives there.+__

<(84)1 - Your kidnapper, for sure.__
<(84)2 - The person interfering, at least.__

[Scene 84 __
*Loud impact*+__

That wasn't me.+__

But I can't go back now.+__
#%Oh no.=#+__

<(86)1 - That wasn't a great idea.__
<(87)2 - You need to get out. Quick.__

[Scene 86 __
I- I had no other option though?+ What was I supposed to-+__
